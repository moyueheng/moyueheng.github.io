## 1. 输入即输出
> 输入就用json输入

例如: 我下面的例子进行语义分割

```
{
    "task": "Your task is to perform semantic segmentation on the given <text>.",
    "requirement": [
        "Each segment should be no more than <chunk_size> characters, with <chunk_overlap> characters overlap between adjacent segments.",
        "The segments should be able to cover the entire text without missing any information."
    ],
    "restriction": "Give a similar <format> JSON response",
    "text": "{text}",
    "format": [
        {
            "summary": "<summary>",
            "text": "<text>"
        },
        {
            "summary": "<summary>",
            "text": "<text>"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 2. 给出事例
